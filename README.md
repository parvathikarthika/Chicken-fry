Easy chicken fry recipe with cubed chicken breast pieces and the basic spices you have in your pantry. Goes great with rice and dal or any curry of your choice.
Clean the chicken pieces and place in a bowl.
Add all the spices, ginger garlic paste, salt, and lime juice to this
Mix well until the chicken pieces are well coated. You can also mix the marinade ingredients first in the bowl and then add the chicken pieces and mix together
Cover and refrigerate for a few hours. You can also fry immediately if short on time
Heat oil for deep frying and gently add the chicken pieces to it without overcrowding them
Fry on medium heat stirring occasionally until the chicken pieces are golden brown
Take out one piece and test to see if the pieces are fully cooked
When done, drain and place on kitchen towels for the excess oil to get absorbed
Proceed with the remaining pieces until all done
Serve hot with rice, any curry, and a simple salad. It's best to consume chicken fry on the same day you prepare them
